# ⚠️ DEPRECATED — See docs/implementation.md

This file has been superseded by the v2 implementation specification.

The v1 architecture was SMS-first (missed call → text-back). The v2 architecture is voice-AI-first (missed call → AI answers the call).

See [docs/implementation.md](implementation.md) for the current specification.

The original v1 architecture has been preserved at [docs/architecture-v1-sms-first.md](architecture-v1-sms-first.md) for reference.
